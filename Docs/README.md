# About CTF
In order to celebrate Programmer's and Tester's Day, we have prepared for you a mini-game in the style of Capture the Flag, or CTF.

CTF competitions use specially implemented weak points of the system in order to find the flag.

The flag itself is usually a specific string of characters, in our case in the flag format ciso{...}.

The competition consists of four tasks from the Web category. The solution to a task will be a link to the next task. In the last task, the solution is a flag that has to be send to the indicated e-mail address together with a brief description of how to solve each task. Knowledge of the vulnerabilities included in the OWASP Top 10 is sufficient to solve the tasks.

If you solve just one, two or three tasks you can also send us information how you solved them and win a prize!

# Rules
